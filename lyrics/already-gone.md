# Already Gone

## Verse 1
I stitched my silence to your name  
And called it love, called it restraint  
The room still breathes like it remembers you  
And every shadow knows my shape  
I learned to smile with broken teeth  
To speak in calm while bleeding truth  
Your warmth was never meant to stay  
It only taught me how to bruise  

## Pre-Chorus 1
If you still hold me in your chest  
Unclench your hands and set me down  
I rot when mercy looks like hope  
And hope still wears your face somehow  

## Chorus
Let me go before I break  
I’m not the one you’re meant to save  
I don’t need light, I live in scars  
You can’t destroy what’s already gone  
If you still care, then let it fade  
Don’t say my name, don’t make me stay  
Some hearts survive by staying buried  
Some loves die best when left alone  

## Verse 2
I carved my faith from borrowed lies  
And prayed you’d never hear the sound  
Of something fragile turning cold  
The moment you refused to drown  
I keep your echoes in my throat  
They taste like rust, they taste like blame  
I don’t need saving anymore  
I’ve made a home inside this pain  

## Pre-Chorus 2
I couldn’t face a life with you  
Knowing you chose to walk away  
You never fought, you never stayed  
You just survived me anyway  

## Chorus
Let me go before I break  
I’m not the one you’re meant to save  
I don’t need light, I live in scars  
You can’t destroy what’s already gone  
If you still care, then let it fade  
Don’t say my name, don’t make me stay  
Some hearts survive by staying buried  
Some loves die best when left alone  

## Bridge
So choke your mercy down my throat  
It won’t revive what you let die  
Heaven survives through control  
And I’m done asking myself why  
You burned it down to feel okay  
Then wore your guilt like honesty  
I loved you in the only way  
That taught me what love should never be  

## Outro
If this was love, then let it rot  
Don’t resurrect what time has killed  
Some things survive by staying buried  
Some hearts break best when left unfilled
